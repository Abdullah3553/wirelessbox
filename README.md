# Wireless Box 
Engineering gives us tools to think and implement solutions to solve specific problems. Problem solving is about making our everyday life simpler and easier. 

# What is Wireless Box? 
Today's smartphones are "mostly" AUX-free. Which means it does not support the common and lovely 3.5mm AUX port anymore. On the other hand, speakers and headphones still use 3.5mm AUX ports as industry standard.
So how do we connect our high-quality speaker that uses AUX cable to the smartphone? YUB Bluetooth!! Wireless Box is just a box that contain an AUX port as an input connected to a Bluetooth adapter to emit and receive sound. 

# WHY?? 
Well, we can just buy a Bluetooth speaker, right?? Well... you can BUT, you would buy a Bluetooth headphone and another Bluetooth speaker and another Bluetooth media player for the car etc... Having a Box that provides the "Wireless" functionality is useful and encapsulated. So, you can have your "Box" everywhere for whatever AUX-port and it will work just as a normal Bluetooth device. 

# Bro you are a programmer?!
Ummmm, I am not specifically a programmer rather than an engineer. I am a problem solver and an engineer. So programming is just a "tool" that I would use beside the analysis and problem-solving skills to obtain a real-life solution. This project might NOT have a lot of coding, but has a lot to do with problems solving and real-life experience.
